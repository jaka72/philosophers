// Does it matter how late it dies, in case it should die?


// What if a struct philo ph[i] is not passed as address into function, 
//   how can you than use mutex_lock in this function with this philo ??
//				mutex_lock(&philo->mutex_time)  with or without & ???


// MYSLEEP() CAUSES THAT TIME IS UPDATED, SO IT NEVER DIES IN CASE OF SHORT TIMETODIE
// NOW WITH USLEEP() I GET floating point exeption, WHEN IT SHOULD DIE 4 310 200 200 
// PROBABLY THERE IS ALSO ISSUE WITH TIMER - HOW DOES IT KNOW WHICH PHILOSOPHER IS BEING CHECKED ???

Does it matter after how many meals he dies, in case it should die?


What if a struct philo ph[i] is not passed as address into function, 
   how can you than use mutex_lock in this function with this philo ??
				mutex_lock(&philo->mutex_time)  with or without & ???


MYSLEEP() CAUSES THAT TIME IS UPDATED, SO IT NEVER DIES IN CASE OF SHORT TIMETODIE
NOW WITH USLEEP() I GET floating point exeption, WHEN IT SHOULD DIE 4 310 200 200 
PROBABLY THERE IS ALSO ISSUE WITH TIMER - HOW DOES IT KNOW WHICH PHILOSOPHER IS BEING CHECKED ???


About 10 milisecs later message:
	The subject that in case of death, message can have 10 milisecs delay.
